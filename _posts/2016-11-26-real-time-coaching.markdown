On the first day of [XP Days 2016 Benelux](http://www.xpday.net/2016/), I attended the [Real Time Coaching](http://www.xpday.net/2016/thursday/#session_468) workshop given by agile coach [Dajo Breddels](http://www.dajobreddels.com/) and hypnotherapist Wijnand van Colle.
Their intent was to give us some insights from Neuro-Science and combine that with some NLP techniques, to make us more effective coaches.
In this post, I will guide you through the workshop and tell you the things I learned.

First they gave us an explanation about the different types of brain waves. It seems that when we're engaged in activities, our brain is producing beta waves. There are also other types of waves, including alpha, theta and delta waves. Gamma waves also exist. These are said to be great for learning but it in not easy to tap into. Dajo and Wijnand gave us the choice: we could meditate for years and years like Buddhist monks, or we could try flipping a necker cube.
