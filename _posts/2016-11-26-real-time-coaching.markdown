On the first day of [XP Days 2016 Benelux](http://www.xpday.net/2016/), I attended the [Real Time Coaching](http://www.xpday.net/2016/thursday/#session_468) workshop given by agile coach [Dajo Breddels](http://www.dajobreddels.com/) and hypnotherapist Wijnand van Colle.
Their intent was to give us some insights from Neuro-Science and combine that with some NLP techniques, to make us more effective coaches.
In this post, I will guide you through the workshop and tell you the things I learned.

# Gamma waves

First they gave us an explanation about the different types of brain waves. It seems that when we're engaged in activities, our brain is mainly generating beta waves. There are also other types of waves, including alpha, theta, delta and gamma waves. Gamma waves are said to be great for learning but they are not easy to tap into. Dajo and Wijnand gave us the choice: we could meditate for years and years like Buddhist monks, or we could try flipping a [necker cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necker_cube).

By meditating a few minutes on the necker cube each day, we could trigger our gamma waves and as a result be more open for learning and absorbing information better. Honestly, I didn't feel any different afterwards, but I will give Dajo and Wijnand the benefit of the doucbt since we only tried it once for a few minutes.   

# Neurons, neural networks and BDNF

Next they explained us what a neuron is and how they form neural networks. Neurons fire impulses across a pathway and thus forming a network. The more impulses are fired along certain paths, the stronger these networks become. They linked this back to addictions... We also talked a bit about something called brain-derived neurotrophic factor or BDNF. It's a protein that is found in the brain and it stimulates the survival of existing neurons and also the growth of new neurons. I'm zooming in to this because they said you can increase your BDNF level by sleeping well and doing physical exercise! Sadly I'm not exercising right now, nor am I sleeping, because I really would like to get this blog post out.

# Rewiring the brain

Next up was Neuroplasticity, which is about how the brain is constantly changing with each activity you do. My take-away there is that you can't learn how to ride a bike just by reading about it. You have to get out there and do it and when you do, your brain will change to make you better at this the next time.

# Direct Feedback

Now it was time to apply all this theory to refine our coaching skills. The most important thing I learned was about coaching at the right time, which is while the activity is still going on. I'll try to explain why this is so very important: when a coachee is doing an activity, he's firing impulses in a certain area in the brain. When you as a coach are coaching him/her, this is also firing impulses in another part of the brain. In order for your coaching to _stick_, connections must be establshed betweend these different parts. These connections can ony be established while both parts are busy firing impulses. In conclusion, coaching must be done by giving direct feedback!

The trainers also mentioned the effect of the [feedback sandwich](http://www.mindacademy.nl/nlp/sandwich-feedback-model). They described it as the sandwich is warming up the brain to be open for some criticism.
